# bazel-buildbarn configuration

Configuration scripts for a simple local deployment of [buildbarn](https://github.com/buildbarn),
a Go implementation of a Bazel remote execution backend.

This is just for testing, it's unsuitable for any real use.

## Usage

Build the servers:

```
./build.sh
```

and run them:

```
./start.sh
```
